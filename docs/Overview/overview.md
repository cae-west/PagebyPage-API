# Introduction

Page by Page is a REST API that transforms the reading experience by simplifying the library management and note taking process. Instead of writing in the margins or sifting through bookshelves, the platform allows users to log, store, and retrieve data based on a unique book or journal entry ID.

## Great for casual readers and avid readers

- Start reading more or keep up your reading streak.
- Track the pages you finish and time you spend on each book.
- Write notes about your thoughts and feelings as you read.
- See how your reading habit grows over time.

## Perfect for students

- Manage reading assignments by logging book data and retrieving current page number or reading status.
- Retrieve notes instantly resulting in less time shuffling through textbook pages and more time actively studying.
